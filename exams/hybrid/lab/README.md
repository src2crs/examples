# Lab Part

The exam's lab part consists of a series of assignments
which are developed here including the solutions.
For the actual exam, the solutions have to be removed.

The students' submissions will afterwards be copied into the directory
[submissions](submissions/README.md), where they can be tested and graded.
Grading can take place at least semi automatically using Source2Course and
the tests given in the [assignments](assignments/README.md) folder.
